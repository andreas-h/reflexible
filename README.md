## About ##

reflexible is a complete rewrite of the pflexible module that was orginally
written to work with FLEXPART model output. The new design goals of reflexible
will drive significant changes from the prior module but provide greater
flexibility.

The reflexible module is being developed to provide an unified data analysis
tool for working with geophysical model data. FLEXPART tools will be the initial
target group, but other models (WRF, ENKI hydrologic model, etc.) are included
in the development plans.

The main paradigm of development and the data model is to work on top of netcdf
files. Specific 'Headers' will be created for relevant models. If the data is
not natively in netcdf format from the model, it will be converted. The user
will have the option to save this converted output for later use.

Initially we aim to provide:

  a. an interface to read model output and provide general information about the simulation
  b. tools for simple access to the data
  c. simple visualization tools


Some routines were initially created to work with FLEXPART model
ouput. [FLEXPART](http://transport.nilu.no/flexpart) is a Lagrangian particle
dispersion model.

This software was written for the purposes of conducting research and displaying
model results for publications. More information can be found on my
[homepage](http://folk.uio.no/johnbur).

## Working with reflexible

There are a few 'gotchas' when using the module. First, you will
likely have to recompile (f2py) the FortFlex.f file and create a
FortFlex.so module for whatever computer you're using. For this you
need a Fortran compiler (gfortran) installed, so sometimes that can be
an issue.

An alternative 'BinaryFile' class has been created so one can work
with pure Python. Alone, it is significantly slower than the FortFlex
module, however, if you use the dumpgrid module, significant speedups
can be achieved. For this run:

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This will compile the pflexcy.pyx file into a pflexcy.so module that
can be imported and used by the pf.readgrid function. A series of
tests are run to try and determine the best module to use -- somewhat
transparently to the user. See the reflexible.readgridV8 function for
more information.

Primary functionality comes from the readheaderV8 function and the
readgridV8 function. I have created a "Header" class that can be used
for some typical analysis. See the examples directory, and don't
forget to read the source code and the [getting
started](http://reflexible.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html)
documentation.

## Testing reflexible

reflexible comes with a suite of test units that you can run in a
series of ways after you compiled the extensions and before you
install it:

    $ PYTHONPATH=. python -c "import reflexible; reflexible.test()"

or:

    $ PYTHONPATH=. python reflexible/tests/all.py

or using the excellent py.test (recommended for developers):

    $ PYTHONPATH=. py.test

## Installation

If all is working correctly, then you can install it (you might need
to be superuser here):

    $ python setup.py install

And *hopefully* everything works!.

## Reporting problems

When you run into problems it is always nice that when you are filing
a ticket you would add the information about the versions you are
using.  You can do that via the `pf.print_versions()`.  Here it is an
output example::

    $ python -c "import reflexible; reflexible.print_versions()"
    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
    reflexible version: 0.10.0
    NumPy version:     1.9.0
    Python version:    2.7.8 |Anaconda 2.1.0 (64-bit)| (default, Aug 21 2014, 18:22:21)
    [GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)]
    Platform:          linux2-x86_64
    Byte-ordering:     little
    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

## Key Tools

The primary workflow and usefulness of reflexible comes from the
read_header and read_grid routines, which are designed to help
ultimately with plotting and data analysis of the FLEXPART output.

To get started, at least become familiar with:

* Header class
* read_header
* read_grid
* fill_backward
* plot_sensitivity

NOTE: the other plotting functions are mostly wrappers which
ultimately make a call to plot_sensitivity.

## Disclaimer

About the mapping.py module, it is primarily designed as some
convenience routines for working with basemap.

All these routines were written 'on the fly', without a design plan or
test cases. Everything probably could use a rewrite!
